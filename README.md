# BandoriWidgets
***This is a fork of the original BandoriWidgets by Halloyo with no further modifications whatsoever***

**BandoriWidgets** is a Rainmeter widget set for all BanG Dreamers (BanG Dream! fans) to display the current status of its events from BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! with the use of [Bestdori](https://bestdori.com/)'s API. Each server (Japan, Taiwan, Global, Korea, and China) is independently loaded.

**Make sure you need to set in your UTC in @Resources\variables.inc**

# Download
Method 1: You can download the .rmskin file and click on `Install` as it will added to the Skins folder.
Method 2: Download and extract the  master repository in `...\Rainmeter\Skins\`.

The widgets won't show up afterward. Please set it up manually based on the server you are playing with.


# Customization
All customizations can be set by editing the variables via `...\Rainmeter\Skins\BandoriWidgets\@Resources\variables.inc`.
For other customizations, you can directly edit the widget .ini files respectively. Edit the source below the `Measures` line is not recommended.

# Other notes
* Event names will be displayed in their respective languages. [e.g. JP server = Japanese, EN server = English]
* You can use either the event's banner or logo. [Make sure it is Safe for Work]
* You can change the banner/logo language as long as it is available (Ex.: Do not use any language besides JP for the JP banners)
* You can change the language and scale of everything


**I do not play Bandori currently, so this will not be updated unless there is a pull request. -Halloyo**
