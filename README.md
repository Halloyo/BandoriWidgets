# BandoriWidgets
A Rainmeter skin to display current event information based on Bestdori's API. Each server is loaded independently.

**Unfortunately, this skin doesn't include information for KR server.**

# Download
Clone this repo to Rainmeter\skins or install the rmskin.

# Customization
Most customization can be done under `...\Rainmeter\skins\Bandori\@Resources\variables.inc`
For further customization, you can directly modify the skin files, but I wouldn't recommend touching anything below the `Measures` line.
